# Pediatrics-Management-System
This is a Pediatrics Management System developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The system is designed to facilitate the management of pediatric clinic operations by providing role-based access and dynamic features for admins, doctors, and users.

Note: To have access as an administrator or doctor, please contact me at eroliindamazreku@gmail.com!

## Main Features:
Three User Roles:

Admin: Has full access to the admin dashboard after login. The admin can manage all database tables, including patients, users, doctors, appointments, messages, and feedback.

Doctor: After logging in, doctors can view their own appointments and manage their patients by adding, editing, or deleting patient records.

User (Visitor): Visitors can browse public pages such as Home, About Us, Doctors, Gallery, etc. When accessing pages like Contact, Appointments, or Feedback, they are redirected to the login page. New users can register (as normal users only) and gain access to make appointments, send messages, and leave feedback for doctors.

## Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

To improve the user experience and design, I integrated several frontend libraries and tools that help create a more responsive, modern, and user-friendly interface.
